# Decision Log: Hosting Strategy - Railway + Supabase

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - 2024-01-XX

## Context
We need to host the Maybe personal finance application for development, testing, and potentially production use. The application is a Ruby on Rails 7.2 app with PostgreSQL, Redis, and external integrations (OpenAI, Plaid, Stripe, Synth API).

### Current Application Requirements
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 7.2 with PostgreSQL
- **Background Jobs**: Sidekiq + Redis
- **External Services**: OpenAI, Plaid, Stripe, Synth API
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus) with TailwindCSS
- **Deployment**: Docker support with `compose.example.yml`
- **Modes**: Managed and self-hosted deployment options

### Constraints
- **Budget**: Prefer free/low-cost hosting options
- **Simplicity**: Easy setup and maintenance
- **Scalability**: Room to grow from development to production
- **Integration**: Need for social authentication and real-time features
- **Avoidance**: Explicitly avoiding Firebase

## Decision
We will use **Railway** for application hosting and **Supabase** for database, authentication, and real-time features.

## Options Considered

### 1. Railway + Supabase âœ… **SELECTED**

#### Pros
- **Railway Benefits**:
  - Excellent Rails support with automatic deployments

- **Production**: $25-50/month

## Rationale

### Why Railway?

1. **Rails-First Approach**: Railway is built with Rails developers in mind, offering seamless integration and automatic detection of Rails applications.

2. **Generous Free Tier**: 500 hours/month is sufficient for development and testing, allowing us to evaluate the platform without cost.

3. **Built-in Services**: Native support for PostgreSQL and Redis eliminates the need for external service configuration.

4. **Developer Experience**: 
   - GitHub integration for automatic deployments
   - Easy environment variable management
   - Built-in monitoring and logging
   - Simple scaling options

5. **Performance**: Good performance characteristics for Rails applications with proper resource allocation.

### Why Supabase?

1. **Perfect Technology Fit**: 
   - PostgreSQL-native (Maybe already uses PostgreSQL)
   - No database migration complexity
   - Familiar SQL interface

2. **Authentication System**:
   - Built-in social login providers (Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.)
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - User management dashboard

3. **Real-Time Features**:
   - WebSocket-based real-time subscriptions
   - Perfect for live financial data updates
   - Automatic reconnection and error handling

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Edge functions for webhooks and background processing
   - Storage for file uploads (account logos, documents)
   - Row Level Security for multi-tenant data isolation
   - Excellent TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs

5. **Cost-Effective**: Generous free tier allows development and small-scale production use.

### Why Not Other Options?

- **Firebase**: Explicitly avoided per requirements
- **Self-hosting**: Too much operational overhead for our needs
- **Heroku**: Too expensive and no free tier
- **Render**: Free tier limitations (spin-down) create poor user experience
- **Fly.io**: More complex setup, though excellent for Docker-based apps

## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration
```ruby
# 1. Export existing schema
rails db:schema:dump

# 2. Update database configuration
# config/database.yml
production:
  adapter: postgresql
  url: <%= ENV['SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL'] %>

# 3. Run migrations on Supabase
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```

### Authentication Migration
```ruby
# 1. Add Supabase configuration
# config/initializers/supabase.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  config.supabase_url = ENV['SUPABASE_URL']
  config.supabase_anon_key = ENV['SUPABASE_ANON_KEY']
  config.supabase_service_key = ENV['SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY']
end

# 2. Update User model
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def self.from_supabase_auth(supabase_user)
    find_or_create_by(supabase_id: supabase_user.id) do |user|
      user.email = supabase_user.email
      user.name = supabase_user.user_metadata['name']
    end
  end
end

# 3. Update authentication flow
# app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  def create_with_supabase
    auth_data = params[:auth]
    supabase_user = verify_supabase_token(auth_data[:access_token])
    
    @user = User.from_supabase_auth(supabase_user)
    session[:user_id] = @user.id
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Application deploys successfully on Railway
- [ ] Database migrates without data loss
- [ ] Authentication works with social providers
- [ ] Real-time features function correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 2s page load)

### Business Success
- [ ] Development team can deploy changes easily
- [ ] Cost remains within budget
- [ ] System is reliable and available
- [ ] Easy to scale as user base grows

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy dependence on Railway and Supabase
   - **Mitigation**: Keep Docker configuration, maintain database exports

2. **Cost Escalation**: Costs could grow with usage
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor usage, implement cost alerts, plan for migration if needed

3. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Supabase
   - **Mitigation**: Provide training, documentation, gradual migration

4. **Integration Complexity**: Supabase integration might be complex
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic features, iterate gradually

### Contingency Plans
- **If Railway becomes too expensive**: Migrate to Fly.io or self-hosting
- **If Supabase has issues**: Fall back to PostgreSQL + custom auth
- **If performance is poor**: Optimize queries, add caching, consider CDN

## Monitoring and Review

### Key Metrics
- Application uptime and performance
- Database performance and usage
- Authentication success rates
- Real-time connection stability
- Cost tracking and optimization

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Performance and cost review
- **Monthly**: Architecture and feature review
- **Quarterly**: Strategic hosting review

## Conclusion

The Railway + Supabase combination provides the best balance of:
- **Cost-effectiveness** (free/low-cost tiers)
- **Ease of use** (simple setup and management)
- **Feature completeness** (auth, real-time, storage)
- **Scalability** (room to grow)
- **Technology fit** (PostgreSQL-native, Rails-friendly)

This decision enables rapid development and deployment while providing a solid foundation for future growth and feature development.
